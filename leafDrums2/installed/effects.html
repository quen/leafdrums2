<h1>Applying effects</h1>

<p>You can apply effects such as delay, phaser, flanger, and gate to drum or loop sounds.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>To apply an effect to a sound, first select that line. Then select either of the numbered slots
under "effects", 1 or 2. Then choose an effect type from the list. Finally, adjust the effect settings 
that appear. You'll normally need to alter these settings, in particular "effect mix" - this usually
defaults all the way to the left, which means that the effect is not actually mixed into the resulting
sound so you won't hear it.</p>

<h2>The effect processing chain</h2>

<p>Sounds are processed in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Original sound (after conversion to stereo 44 kHz)
<li>Adjustments from the bottom-left panel (length, fade-in, fade-out, or stretching)
<li>Effect #1
<li>Effect #2
<li>Panning and volume adjustment
</ul>

<p>This processing is not carried out "live" - sounds are recalculated only when the situation
changes, for example when you alter an effect or effect settings. Normally you won't need to know
this, but there are a few situations where it can have an effect. Most notably, the total length
of sounds is limited, so you can't make a sound echo forever using the delay option, after a short
time it will fade.</p>
