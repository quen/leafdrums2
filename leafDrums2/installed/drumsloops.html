<h1>Understanding the basic concepts</h1>

<h2>Drums and loops</h2>

<p>At the simplest level, leafDrums can play either <i>drum</i> or <i>loop</i> sounds.</p>

<p><i>Drum</i> sounds are WAV files. Normally these contain a percussive sound which lasts only
a short time. The sound is always played at the same pitch, although its volume and panning position
(left-right stereo) may be altered, and sometimes its length or the strength of its attack can also 
be changed. </p>

<p><i>Loops</i> are also WAV files. However, these normally represent entire drum-loops. They are
stretched depending on the tempo of the current rhythm, in order to exactly fit a certain number of beats
(for example, one bar). This results in pitch changes.</p>

<p>In leafDrums, you can find drums and loops in the list that occupies the bottom left of the display.</p>

<h2>Patterns, bars and lines</h2>

<p>A <i>pattern</i> is an entire drum pattern, from beginning to end. You can save and load patterns.
Normally a pattern consists of a certain number of bars, which are then repeated.</p>

<p>A <i>bar</i> is a unit of time - in leafDrums, it is always 4 beats [or 16 time units] long. 
The length of a beat depends on the current tempo in beats-per-minute.</p>

<p>A <i>line</i> is one horizontal line of the pattern. Each line represents one drum sound (for example,
a bass drum). In the line you can specify when that particular sound should play.</p>

<p>Lines take up the top half of the screen, where the volume level for each line is displayed along
with the drum or loop sound used in that line, and the actual data for that line (when there is a "hit" on
that drum). One line is "selected" which means that you can alter its sound settings such as volume, 
panning and effects - to select a line, click on its drum name.</p>
