<h1>Tweaking drum or loop sounds</h1>

<p>Drum or loop sounds can both be customised slightly to suit the rhythm you are creating.</p>

<h2>Drum sounds</h2>

<p>When you select a drum sound, three scrollbars below the list of drum sounds become active.</p>

<p>These allow you to alter the <i>length</i> of the sound - in other words, you can cut off the end - and 
to control how quickly the sound comes <i>in</i> at its beginning and goes <i>out</i> at its end. By default, 
the sound begins and ends playing completely abruptly, going from nothing to full volume instantly and 
vice versa.</p>

<p>Adjusting these sliders allows you to alter the attack and decay of some sounds (how well it works
depends on the samples involved, but it is especially useful with "open hi-hat" cymbal sounds).</p>

<h2>Loops</h2>

<p>With loops there is only one control - a slider for the number of beats. You can make the loop any
length between one time-unit and 16 time units (i.e. up to 4 beats or 1 bar). The loop will be automatically
stretched to fill that many beats, whatever the tempo. (This results in changes in pitch.)
