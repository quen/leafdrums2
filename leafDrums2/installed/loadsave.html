<h1>Loading and saving</h1>

<p>You can load and save patterns in the usual way, with the "Open" and "Save" buttons.</p>

<p>Note that the drum sounds themselves are not saved with pattern files. In order to load and play a
pattern, you must have the correct drum and loop files in leafDrum's folders. If you need to exchange 
pattern files with somebody else, or to make backup copies of your pattern files, be sure to include the
WAV files that were used by the pattern.</p>
