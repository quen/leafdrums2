<h1>Writing your pattern to disk</h1>

<p>As well as saving your pattern, you can write it out to disk in WAV format. You will probably
want to do this so that you can use the pattern in your sequencer or other sound-editing programs.</p>

<p>To write the pattern to disk, click the "Write" button near the top left. Then enter the name of a
WAV file to be written. Your entire pattern will be written to that WAV file, in 44 kHz 16-bit stereo.
