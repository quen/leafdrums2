<h1>Ordering information</h1>

<p>
leafDrums costs $20 US. Once you register (pay for the program), you will be given a code which 
removes the nag screens etc.
</p>

<p>
Registering for the program helps encourage me to write more music software, as well as being
the Right Thing to do rather than using pirated or unregistered software. :)
</p>

<h2>Ordering online</h2>

<p>If you have a credit card you can order securely online. This is the quickest and easiest way
to order the program.</p>

<h2>Ordering by mail</h2>

<p>
If you don't have a credit card or you don't have Internet access, you can also order by mail. 
Please print and follow the instructions on <a href="form.html">this form</a>. You will need to 
send 20 US dollars <i>in cash</i> - we cannot accept cheques (the bank charges about $20 for us to
pay in a US cheque, so it's not an option). If you don't live in the US, you should be able to easily 
purchase 20 US dollars from a bank, travel agent, or bureau de change.
</p>

<p>
If it's more convenient for you, you may alternatively pay in UK pounds sterling (the program costs 
15 UK pounds). Again, this must be cash.
</p>

<p>
International mail can sometimes take some time - please allow at least 2 weeks for a response (if you
give an e-mail address - more otherwise).
</p>

<h2>Ordering from within the UK</h2>

<p>
If you live in the UK, you may also pay by cheque drawn on a UK bank, for 15 pounds made payable to 
Samuel Marshall.
</p>

<p>
The dollar amount is (at time of writing) likely to be a little cheaper, so you are better off registering
online if you have a credit card and internet access. (I encourage this because it's easier for me.)
