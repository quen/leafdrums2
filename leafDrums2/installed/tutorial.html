<h1>Quick-start tutorial</h1>

<p>
This tutorial assumes you have just launched leafDrums. (If you've messed about with it, you can return
it to a "clean" state by clicking the "new" button.) If you want to do the whole tutorial now, you
should allow about ten minutes, or more if you want to play around with it at each stage.
</p>

<h2>Screen layout</h2>

<p>The screen is divided into three portions. From top to bottom, these are:</p> 

<ul>
<li> A <i>control bar</i> for general program settings relating to the whole drum rhythm.
<li> An upper <i>pattern area</i> for editing the drum rhythm and placing drum hits in a pattern.
<li> A lower <i>sound area</i> for controlling an individual drum line - selecting which drum sound
     is used for that line, and controlling aspects about that sound.
</ul>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Begin by selecting a drum sound for the top line in the drum pattern.</p>

<ul>
<li> Select the top line by clicking on the word "(none)" in the drum/loop section of the pattern area,
     to ensure that it is highlighted.
<li> In the sound area, click the word "drum" at the left to make sure it's selected. Then choose a 
     drum sound from the list below, such as "bass_drum". That is the drum sound which will be used
	 for the selected line in the pattern area.
</ul>

<p><a href="selecting.html">(More detailed information...)</a></p>

<p>Now add some drum hits to the pattern.</p>

<ul>
<li> Look at the right-hand section of the pattern area. You should be able to see 4 beats, divided
     into 16 time units.
<li> The top line of this pattern area corresponds to the drum sound you just selected. In this line,
     click with the left or right mouse buttons to add some drum hits.
</ul>

<p><a href="patternarea.html">(More detailed information...)</a></p>

<p>Listen to the pattern.</p>

<ul>
<li> At the left of the control bar, there is a button marked "go". Click on that button to begin hearing
     the pattern.
<li> You should hear the pattern that you made, repeating. If you like, you can click to add or remove
     drum hits on the pattern.
<li> Adjust the tempo slider (in the control bar).
<li> When you're finished, click the "stop" button (in the same place as "go") to stop hearing the rhythm.
</ul>

<h2>Multiple drum sounds</h2>

<p>Add another drum sound.</p>

<ul>
<li> Select the second, blank line by clicking on the word "(none)" in the drum/loop section of the pattern
     area.
<li> Choose another drum sound for this line in the same way as before.
<li> Add some drum hits to this line in the pattern area.
<li> You may want to play the pattern again to see how it sounds. You can add more different drum sounds
     if you like. You can have as many as you want - if you need more than the six which fit on screen, you
	 can use the scroll-bar at the right of the pattern area.
</ul>

<h2>Patterns more than one bar long</h2>

<p>Add an extra bar to the pattern.</p>

<ul>
<li> At the top of the pattern area there are small left/right arrow controls.
<li> Click the right-arrow button to go to the next bar. You should see that it is blank.
<li> Also notice that the display reads "2 (max 1)" - there is still only one bar in the pattern. This
     bar will only begin to be used once you add some drum hits to it.
<li> Add some hits to this bar of the pattern.
<li> The display should now read "2 (max 2)". If you click Play, you should now hear that both bars will
     be included in the looped playback.
</ul>

<p>Use Copy and Paste to make duplicates of an existing bar.</p>

<ul>
<li> Use the left and right arrows to choose one or other bar.
<li> Click the Copy button in the control bar to make an invisible copy of this bar in the clipboard.
<li> Now use the right arrow to go to the last, blank bar "3 (max 2)". Click Paste to paste in the
     bar you just copied.
<li> Note that, if you paste a bar into the middle of a pattern, bars after it are shifted along to make
     room. For example, if you paste a bar into bar 2, then the bar that was previously 2 will now be 3, 
	 and so on.
</ul>

<p>Use Cut to remove unwanted bars.</p>

<ul>
<li> Use the left and right arrows to select a bar you no longer want.
<li> Click the Cut button to remove that bar (and store a copy of it in the clipboard).
<li> The bar is deleted, and the bars after it shuffle along to fill the gap.
<li> If you change your mind, click Paste to bring the deleted bar back from the clipboard.
</ul>
