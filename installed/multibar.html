<h1>Multi-bar patterns</h1>

<p>Although you can make drum rhythms with only one bar, most will have two or more.
</p>

<h2>Getting around bars</h2>

<p>You can view different bars using the left/right arrows by the word "pattern". The "max" number shows
how many bars there are.</p>

<p>The controls let you go one bar further than the maximum. If you add any drum hits to this extra bar, 
it becomes the new maximum (in other words, you've added a bar to the end of the pattern).</p>

<h2>Cut, copy, and paste</h2>

<p>These three buttons refer to the current bar. For example, if you want to delete a bar from the
pattern, you can click Cut. If you want to make three more copies of a bar (so that you can alter them
slightly, perhaps), click Copy and then click Paste three times.</p>
