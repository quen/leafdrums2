<h1>Adding drumbeats</h1>

<p>In the pattern area of the screen, click the mouse to add a "drum hit" in any location. (Time goes
from left to right, and the horizontal drum lines determine which sound will be used for the hit.)</p>

<p>You can left-click to add (or remove) a normal-intensity hit. If you right-click, you will add an
accented hit. Accented hits are normally louder than normal hits, but you can adjust normal and accented
volume independently for the selected line using the scrollbars at the bottom right of the screen.</p>

<p>If the 16 time units available don't provide sufficiently precise control, you can "nudge" a beat to
place it to the left or right of its current position (earlier or later in time). To do this, hold down
the Ctrl key and click on the beat - with the left mouse button, if you want to move it left, or the right
button, if you want to move it right.</p>

<p>To hear the effect of the drumbeats you added, click the Go button at top left to hear the pattern 
repeated. (This plays the whole pattern, not just the current bar.)</p>

<p>To adjust the tempo of the whole pattern, use the sliders at the top of the display. With these sliders
you can also adjust the volume and "humanise" the playing (this adds random timing errors).</p>
