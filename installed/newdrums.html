<h1>Adding new drum or loop sounds</h1>

<p>You can add your own drum or loop sounds to the program, or sounds that you've downloaded from the Web.</p>

<p>First ensure that your sounds are 16-bit uncompressed WAV files. They can be either mono or 
stereo, and at any sampling frequency (we recommend 44 kHz - if you use another frequency it is converted to 
44 kHz internally). You can use any sound editing program to convert their format if necessary.</p>

<p>Then drag the WAV files into the appropriate folder. leafDrums has two folders, one for drums and one 
for loops. You can open a window on the folders by selecting "drum" or "loop" on the leafDrums display, and
then clicking the folder icon just to the right.</p>

<p>Once you've dragged the WAV file into the right folder, it should appear on the list of available 
sounds. You can now select it to use in a drum pattern.</p>
